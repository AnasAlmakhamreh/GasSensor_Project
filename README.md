# GasSensor_Project
This is a simple gas leak detector project built using a PIC16F877A microcontroller, an MQ-02 gas sensor, an LCD, two LEDs, and a buzzer.  When the sensor detects gas (like butane or LPG), the system:  Displays a warning on the LCD,  Activates the buzzer,  And lights up the LED indicators.  I tested it using a lighter to simulate a gas leak.
